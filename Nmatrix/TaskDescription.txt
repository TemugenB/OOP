Implement the types using classes. Represent the types using sequences of same-type
elements (List<> in C#).
Create a main program with a menu to demonstrate the services (all the methods) a class
provides in arbitrary order (based on the selections of the user). Make the main program
instantiate an object of the class. The methods of the class can be called through the menu
items. Print the state of the object either after the completion of each menu item or through
another menu item for printing. If there are methods or friend functions that need multiple
objects (like adding two matrices, for example), the main program should make it possible to
create and print these objects through the menu.
Implement unit tests which should be run automatically.
Implement the N matrix type which contains integers. These are
square matrices that can contain nonzero entries only in their first
and last column, and in their main diagonal. Don't store the zero
entries. Store only the entries that can be nonzero in a sequence.
Implement as methods: getting the entry located at index (i, j),
adding and multiplying two matrices, and printing the matrix (in a
square shape).
