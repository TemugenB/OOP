Database of a university is stored in a text file. One line of code consists of the semester, the neptun code of the professor, and how many class hours 
the professor has spent with teaching in that semester. The file is ordered by semester, and you can suppose that it is not empty. 
One sample file:
19/20/2 gfhdjs 10
20/21/1 fghdjs 16
20/21/1 jhsdjd 18
20/21/1 hflsjh 12
20/21/1 gfhdjs 10
20/21/1 jkdled 12
21/22/1 ghdsnk 12
Which was the easiest semester (with the least teaching hours in total)? You have to create a class with method first(), current(), next(), and end() for 
enumerating the semesters with their teaching hours in total. Other public classes can not be created
