Database of a pen store is stored in a text file. One database element consists of the
brand of the pen, the color of the pen and the number of pieces the store has of this
pen.
The file is ordered by brand and you can suppose that it is not empty. One color of
one brand cannot be found in multiple lines.
One sample file:

Parker red 40

Parker blue 70

Stabilo green 20

Stabilo blue 5

Stabilo orange 20
Task:

Which brands have more than 70 pens in the database? You have to create a
class with methods first(), next(), current(), and end() for enumerating the total number
of pens for each brand. Other public methods cannot be created for this class.
In the sample file the output is Parker.
Requirements: You cannot store multiple lines of the file and you can
open the file only once.
